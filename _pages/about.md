I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.uwyo/edu/cosc) at the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu) located in beautiful Laramie, Wyoming!

I currently serve as the Director of the [Cybersecurity Education and Research (CEDAR) Center](http://www.uwyo.edu/CEDAR).


I am in the process of converting my site over to a Jekyll-powered git-repository backed site. Please check back for updates (especially to this page, my teaching page, and a forthcoming research page).
